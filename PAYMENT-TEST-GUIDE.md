# Quick Payment Testing Guide

## The Problem You Experienced

When you completed a test payment, two things should have happened:
1. ‚úÖ Stripe processed the payment successfully
2. ‚ùå **The webhook didn't update your database** (this is why nothing changed)

## Why It Didn't Work

The **webhook** is the key piece that's missing. Here's what happens:

```
User clicks "Upgrade" 
  ‚Üì
Goes to Stripe checkout
  ‚Üì
Enters card and pays
  ‚Üì
Stripe charges card ‚úÖ
  ‚Üì
Stripe sends webhook to your app ‚ùå (THIS FAILED)
  ‚Üì
Your app updates database (never happened)
  ‚Üì
User returns to settings
  ‚Üì
Still shows upgrade button (because database wasn't updated)
```

## Quick Fix for Local Testing

### Step 1: Install Stripe CLI

**Windows:**
```powershell
# Using Scoop
scoop install stripe

# Or download from: https://github.com/stripe/stripe-cli/releases
```

**Mac:**
```bash
brew install stripe/stripe-cli/stripe
```

**Linux:**
```bash
# Download and extract from: https://github.com/stripe/stripe-cli/releases
```

### Step 2: Login to Stripe

```bash
stripe login
```

This will open your browser to authorize the CLI.

### Step 3: Start Webhook Forwarding

**Open a NEW terminal** (keep your dev server running in the first one):

```bash
cd C:\Development\myjp-srt
stripe listen --forward-to http://localhost:3000/api/stripe/webhook
```

You'll see:
```
> Ready! Your webhook signing secret is whsec_xxxxxxxxxxxxx
```

### Step 4: Copy the Webhook Secret

Copy the `whsec_` secret shown in the terminal.

### Step 5: Update .env.local

Add or update this line in your `.env.local` file:

```env
STRIPE_WEBHOOK_SECRET=whsec_xxxxxxxxxxxxx
```

(Use the actual secret from Step 4)

### Step 6: Restart Your Dev Server

In your **first terminal** (where `npm run dev` is running):
```bash
# Press Ctrl+C to stop
npm run dev
```

### Step 7: Test Again

1. Go to http://localhost:3000/settings
2. Click "Upgrade to Ad-Free"
3. Use test card: `4242 4242 4242 4242`
4. Use expiry: `12/34`, CVC: `123`, ZIP: `12345`
5. Click "Pay"

### Step 8: Watch the Webhooks!

In your **second terminal** (where Stripe CLI is running), you should see:

```
[200] POST http://localhost:3000/api/stripe/webhook [evt_xxxxx]
‚úÖ Checkout session completed: {...}
üîÑ Updating user xxx to ad-free...
‚úÖ User upgraded successfully: [...]
```

### Step 9: Verify It Worked

After payment, you should:
1. See a green "Payment Successful!" message
2. See "Ad-Free Active!" status
3. No longer see ads on quiz pages

## Manual Verification

If you want to check the database directly:

1. Go to your Supabase project
2. Open Table Editor
3. Select `users` table
4. Find your user by email
5. Check that `is_ad_free` column is `true`

## Quick Manual Fix (For Testing Only)

If you just want to test the ad-free experience without payment:

1. Go to Supabase SQL Editor
2. Run:
```sql
UPDATE users 
SET is_ad_free = true 
WHERE email = 'your-test-email@example.com';
```
3. Refresh the settings page
4. Log out and log back in if needed

## Common Issues

### "Webhook signature verification failed"

**Cause:** Wrong webhook secret in `.env.local`

**Fix:**
1. Check the secret in your Stripe CLI terminal
2. Copy it exactly (including `whsec_`)
3. Update `.env.local`
4. Restart dev server

### Webhook terminal shows nothing

**Cause:** Stripe CLI not running or not forwarding

**Fix:**
1. Make sure `stripe listen` is running
2. Check it says "Ready!" and shows the forward URL
3. Try stopping and starting it again

### Database not updating

**Cause:** Supabase credentials wrong

**Fix:**
1. Check `.env.local` has:
   - `NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL`
   - `SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY` (NOT the anon key!)
2. Restart dev server

### "Payment Successful" message but still showing upgrade button

**Cause:** User data not refreshing

**Fix:**
1. Hard refresh the page (Ctrl+Shift+R)
2. Or log out and log back in
3. Check database to confirm `is_ad_free` is `true`

## Testing Checklist

- [ ] Stripe CLI installed
- [ ] `stripe login` completed
- [ ] `stripe listen` running in separate terminal
- [ ] Webhook secret copied to `.env.local`
- [ ] Dev server restarted after adding secret
- [ ] Test payment completed
- [ ] Webhook received (visible in Stripe CLI terminal)
- [ ] Database updated (`is_ad_free = true`)
- [ ] Settings page shows "Ad-Free Active!"
- [ ] Ads no longer display

## For Production

See **STRIPE-SETUP.md** for production webhook configuration (you'll set up a webhook endpoint in Stripe Dashboard instead of using the CLI).
